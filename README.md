# PetrolTracker-App

Work in progress.

Currently starting another personal project, based on the skills I learnt within my simple To Do list app.

The goal of this application is to have an App that users can enter their kilometers travelled, and petrol used to generate statistics of their driving average against a compared average.

By completion of this project I am hoping to further my Application Development skills, and also learn how to create more detailed graphics, such as graphs
